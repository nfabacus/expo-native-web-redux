# My Health App (Proof of Concept)
Building a sample expo app which can run on ios and android devices as well as web.

## Setup
1. Install expo cli

```npm install --global expo-cli```

2. clone this repo
3. ```yarn``` to install all dependencies
4. Make sure the api backend server and database are also set up

```https://github.com/nfabacus/health-data-api```

5. iOS and android simulators
   For simulators, you will need to install them prior to this. However, you can also run the app via your phone with QR code.
   
6. For android simulator

   You will need to use https server or configure the app further.  For a quick solution, you can use ngrok to spin a https proxy server.
   
   1. Download ngrok and do the following command
   ```./ngrok http 5000``` 
   
   2. Make sure your backend server is running at port 5000.
   
   3. copy https address generated by ngrok
   
   4. create .env file in the root folder of this front end app and add the above address to it.  Follow .env.example.
      ```API_URL=https://6c4w1e69.ngrok.io```
   

## How to Run This Front End App
After all the set up is done
1. ```expo run start``` in your terminal
2. Following the terminal for instruction to open the app.

### Build
With some wiring and coding, Expo will let me generate native IOS and Androd as well as Web apps.

#### Web
Fitbit connection needs some extra step to be added to work for the web.
