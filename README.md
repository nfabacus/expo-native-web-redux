# Expo Native Web WITH redux

I am going to build a sample expo app who can run on ios and android devices as well as web.

Todos:
1. Refresh react native basics (It was 1-2 years ago since I used react native last time).
2. Use react router for web navigation
3. Use redux (also refresher. After this, I am going to use apollo client instead).
4. Connect to an api
5. Add authentication
